# Skin-Disease-Classification-DermaVision

## Project Overview

This project, **DermaVision**, focuses on classifying 15 types of skin diseases using deep learning techniques.  
We implemented an **EfficientNet-B3** model to analyze skin images combined with symptom-based data.  

The dataset was carefully collected and preprocessed to handle class imbalance and visual similarities.  
Our system provides predictions that can support early detection and treatment suggestions.  

We also designed a user-friendly interface to make the tool accessible for non-experts.  

This work highlights the role of AI in healthcare and its potential to assist dermatologists.
